#Codebook for U.S. Senate Returns 1976â€“2018

The data file `1976-2018-senate` contains constituency (state-level) returns for elections to the U.S. Senate from 1976 to 2018.  The data source is the document "[Statistics of the Congressional Election](http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/)," published biennially by the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives. 2018 data comes from official state election websites (in some cases, they are marked as unofficial, and will be updated at a later time).

For analysis that focuses on two-party vote totals, it will be necessary to account for major party candidates who receive votes under multiple party labels. Minnesota party labels are given as they appear on the Minnesota ballots. Future versions of this file will include codes for candidates who are endorsed by major parties, regardless of the party label under which they receive votes.
